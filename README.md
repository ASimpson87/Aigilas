# Aigilas - Currently in Open Alpha Development#
> A battle to become an ambassador to Earth from the Underworld.

## Backstory ##
When we look around each day, a war appears to be raging in the world. Good and evil twist and turn throughout time in a seemingly endless fight for dominion over this planet. Sitting on the throne of evil, we find Lucifer. One could say that he is the orchestrator of the game you are about to play.

At the turn of each century, Lucifer gathers his seven closest demons to participate in a tournament. These elite members of the Underworld represent the deadliest sins committed by mankind. The victor is granted the privilege of walking on the Earth until the proceeding tournament is held, after another one hundred years. Being granted the chance to bring Hell to Earth for an entire century is the most highly valued prize in all of the Underworld, and many acolytes come together to support their respective leader.

These hellbound souls are the main characters in Aigilas. Each player selects a sin to represent, and is granted specific powers depending on their chosen leader. In order to win the tournament, an embodiment of every sin must be defeated. Along their journey, the acolytes will face many other hellbound who want to win it all, so players will need to stay on their toes throughout this challenge.

## Default Controls ##

## Features of the Game ##
* Reactive skill system (similar to combos)
* Procedurally generated dungeons and enemies means the game is never the same twice.
* Support for local co-op with up to four players (with Xbox 360 controllers)
* Built on top of my own SimplePathXna framework


## How to Build the Game##
Prerequisites:

* Visual Studio 2010 (at least Visual C# 2010 Express)
* XNA 4.0 (which is included in Windows Phone Developer Tools)

Open Aigilas.sln in Visual Studio and launch the project. The game should launch shortly after that.

## Supported Platforms ##
Currently, only Windows 7 is tested and supported. A PoC has been done that shows Aigilas can run on MonoGame, which would open up support for Linux and Mac OS X.

The game originally targeted Xbox 360, but then I graduated college and lost my Creators Club account. Should this game ever raise enough interest (and money) to sustain a new account, then I will resume testing on the 360.

## How can I contribute? ##

## Does the name mean anything?##
The name is a reversal of the mneumonic "SALIGIA", which is a term from the 14th century that contained the first initial of each of the seven deadly sins.

## How do I pronounce "Aigilas" ##
"A-JILL-US" (similar to ageless, but without a hard stop between age and less)
