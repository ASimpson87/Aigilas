# Aigilas #
A battle to become an Earthy ambassador from the Underworld.

## Please see the WIKI for more information about the game ##

## Story ##
When we look around each day, there is great evidence that something is at war in the world. Good and evil twist and turn throughout time in a seemingly endless fight for dominion over this little planet. Sitting on the throne of evil, we find Lucifer. One could say that he is the orchestrator is the game you are about to play.

At the turn of each century, Lucifer gathers his seven closest handlers to participate in a tournament. These elite members of the Underworld represent the deadliest sins committed by mankind. The victor is granted the privilege of walking on the Earth until the proceeding tournament is held, after another one hundred years. Being granted the chance to bring Hell to Earth for an entire century is the most highly valued prize in all of the Underworld, and many acolytes come together to support their respective leader under Lucifer’s command.

These hellbound souls are the main characters in Aigilas. Each player selects a sin to represent, and is granted specific powers depending on their chosen leader. In order to win the tournament, an embodiment of every sin must be defeated. Along their journey, the acolytes will face many other hellbound who want to win it all, so players will need to stay on their toes throughout this challenge.

## Features of the Game ##
Reactive skill system (similar to combos)
Procedurally generated dungeons and enemies means the game is never the same twice.
Support for local co-op with up to four players (with Xbox 360 controllers)

## Supported Platforms ##
Currently, only Windows is tested and supported. A PoC has been done that proves Aigilas can run on MonoGame, which would open up support for Linux and Mac OS X.

The game originally targeted Xbox 360, but then I graduated college and lost my Creators Club account.

## How can I contribute? ##
Look through the Roadmap, make suggestions via the Issues page, if all else fails then fire a question my way at the following: xbigtk13x@gmail.com

## Does the name mean anything?##
The name is a reversal of the mneumonic "SALIGIA", which was a term from the 14th century that contained the first initial of each of the seven deadly sins.

## How do I say "Aigilas" ##
A-JILL-US (similar to ageless, but without a hard stop between age and less)
