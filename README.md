# Aigilas - Currently in Open Alpha Development#
> A battle to become an ambassador to Earth from the Underworld.

## How to Build the Game##
Prerequisites:

* Oracle JDK 6
* Intellij IDEA Community Edition

Create a new project in Intellij IDEA from the "proj" directory. Run the class "DesktopMain" as a Java application. The game should launch shortly after that.

## Supported Platforms ##
Windows 7, Mac OS X Lion and Ubuntu 12.04 are all supported to varying degrees..

## How can I contribute? ##
Look through current issues, make suggestions via the issues page, if all else fails then fire a question my way at: xbigtk13x@gmail.com

## Under what licenses is this game? ##
I am a fan of permissive licenses. Please refer to LICENSE.txt for more details, which must be contained in any distribution of source code or binaries. Aigilas is intended to be a project that I can use to help teach others how to make games. I believe that a permissive license makes that goal easier to reach.
